# Week 3: Keyword Search First - The Critical Foundation

> **üö® The 90% Problem:** Most RAG systems jump straight to vector search and miss the foundation that powers the best retrieval systems. We're doing it right!

This folder contains the materials for Week 3 of the arXiv Paper Curator project, where we implement the **keyword search foundation** that professional RAG systems rely on using OpenSearch and BM25 scoring.

## üéØ Why Keyword Search First?

**The Professional Path:** Unlike tutorials that jump straight to vector embeddings, we build the foundation that successful companies use:

1. **üîç Exact Match Power:** Keywords excel at finding specific technical terms, paper IDs, and precise phrases
2. **üìä Interpretable Results:** You can understand exactly why a paper was retrieved 
3. **‚ö° Speed & Efficiency:** BM25 is computationally fast and doesn't require expensive embedding models
4. **üìà Production Reality:** Companies like Elasticsearch, Algolia, and enterprise search use keyword search as their foundation

**The Learning Path:**
```
Week 3: Master BM25 keyword search    ‚Üê YOU ARE HERE
Week 4: Add intelligent chunking
Week 5: Introduce vector embeddings for hybrid retrieval  
Week 6: Optimize the complete system
```

## üöÄ Before You Start

**Essential Environment Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Ensure you have the correct environment configuration
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Verify OpenSearch settings are properly configured
# Your .env should contain these critical Week 3 settings:
# OPENSEARCH__HOST=http://opensearch:9200
# OPENSEARCH__INDEX_NAME=arxiv-papers
```

**Important:** Week 3 requires the `.env` file to be properly configured for OpenSearch connectivity and indexing. The defaults in `.env.example` work out of the box.

## Contents

### `week3_opensearch.ipynb`
A comprehensive Jupyter notebook that guides you through building the keyword search foundation:
